Methodology for Validating the CREDIT Score with Machine Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning methodology for validating the CREDIT Score. The CREDIT Score aims to assist in risk stratification and decision-making for patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic solid cancer admitted to ICU/critical care. This project leverages machine learning techniques to improve the predictive capabilities of the CREDIT Score.

Overview
This project applies a Random Forest classifier to validate the CREDIT Score by modeling the relationships between patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. Key outcomes assessed include:

Survival six months after ICU/critical care admission.
Return to anticancer therapy (ACT).
ECOG PS greater than 2.
The methodology includes robust data preparation, preprocessing, model training, and validation steps to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Data Preparation
Dataset
The dataset comprises comprehensive patient data from the initial CREDIT Score study, including:

Demographic details
Treatment history
Physiological and biochemical characteristics
The dataset focuses on patients admitted to ICU/critical care between January 2018 and December 2019. Missing data was managed using imputation techniques to preserve dataset integrity.

Missing Data Handling
Imputation Techniques:
Categorical Data: Mode imputation.
Numerical Data: Mean imputation or Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).
Preprocessing
Adjustments and Encoding
Categorical Variables: Converted using one-hot encoding to avoid bias.
Specific Handling:
BMI: Missing values imputed using the mean.
Histological Cancer Diagnosis: Transformed into "Diagnosis categories" using one-hot encoding.
Final NEWS 2 Score: Missing values filled with the mode.
ECOG PS: Values on admission and referral imputed using the mode or set to 3 where appropriate.
Fields Removed
Fields with excessive missing data, redundancy, or irrelevance to the analysis were excluded. These include:

APACHE, SAPS, and SOFA fields
Dates (e.g., admission dates)
Specific treatment details with sparse data
Fields with inconsistent or erroneous values
Machine Learning Implementation
The Random Forest classifier was used to validate the CREDIT Score. Key steps include:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the model on the training set.
Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, and feature importance.
Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics
Key Metrics:

AUROC
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC Curves: Used to assess the model's discriminatory power.

Comparison
The model's performance was compared to traditional risk assessment scores like APACHE, SOFA, and SAPS2.

Validation
Internal Validation
Conducted using the testing cohort.
Ensured consistency in model performance.
External Validation
Recommended for future work using independent datasets from diverse clinical settings.
Model Interpretation and Implementation
Interpretation
Feature importance analysis identified the most significant predictors.
Clinical relevance was assessed to validate the utility of the CREDIT Score.
Implementation
Developed guidelines for clinical application.
Recommended training resources for clinicians.
